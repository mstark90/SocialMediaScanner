# Introduction

SocialMediaScanner is a project designed to create analyses of social media posts for students who want to or need to analyze social media for class projects. It is Spring Framework based, and will incorporate Apache Hadoop to analyze data with MongoDB providing the storage for analyses.

This is still a work in progress, so changes will be happening frequently.
